Python *sans* Herpetology
==========================


This is my blog.
It contains whatever I think about.
Most of the time, I am thinking about programming.
Most of the time, I am thinking about Python Programming.
Sometimes I think about other things.
Science things, movie things, music things, gaming things.
Relationship things, spirit things, philosophy things, day to day life things,
Political things, hot button things, public policy things, sex things, non-sex things.
Any of that can be here. Will be here. If I write it.
Read the title. If you don't wanna read about that subject, don't open it.
This is NOT a programming blog.

this is MY blog.
